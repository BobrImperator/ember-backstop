## Installation

### First do this...

```
ember install ember-backstop
```

### Next, for Git...

Add these lines to your `<project>/gitignore`...

```
#backstopjs
html_report
bitmaps_test
```

### If you use Mirage

Add this line to `<project>/mirage/config.json`...

```
this.passthrough('/backstop/**');
```

### If you use Pretender

Add a passthrough in your pretender config file:

Something like this:

```js
this.post('/backstop/**', this.passthrough);
```

### If you test with `ember test`

Add this to your `<project>/testem.js`...

```js
  proxies: {
    '/backstop': {
      target: 'http://localhost:3000',
      secure: false,
    },
  },
```

## Usage

### Backstop-remote service

You will need the backstop-remote service running for visual tests.

In a separate window run...

```
ember backstop-remote
```

Leave that running while you're testing. When you don't need it anymore you can either close the window or run `ember backstop-stop` to stop the service.

### Running Ember Server

Ember-Backstop works with `ember test` and `ember serve` e.g.

```
ember test --server --filter="your_test_name_partial"
```

or

```
ember serve
```

### Adding a visual regression test is simple...

First import the backstop helper into your test...

```js
import backstop from 'ember-backstop/test-support/backstop';
```

Then add an `await backstop(assert);` assertion to any UI state you want to test...

```js
test('it renders the thing', async function(assert) {
  await visit('/sales/company/11102');
  await backstop(assert);
  assert.dom('#myFancyElement').exists();
});
```

Now, whenever you run a test, BackstopJS will take a screen shot and compare it against the last known good.

### The first run

The first time you run backstop-helper tests BackstopJS will fail because there aren't any reference files yet. So, here's what you do...

1. run tests normally
2. When tests complete, in another window run `ember backstop-approve`

Your next test run should now pass.

### View the most recent BackstopJS test report

You can always view the last test run report by running the following in another window...

```
ember backstop-report
```

### Approving changes

Anytime you want to promote a changed test to the new reference file, run...

```
ember backstop-approve
```

This command also takes an optional `filter` parameter e.g.

```
ember backstop-approve --filter=testFilenameAsRegExString
```

### Configuration Options

The backstop helper takes an optional options object.

#### Scenario Option

You can configure BackstopJS scenario options for your tests dynamically by passing a `scenario` object in the options.

```js
test('it renders the thing - selects the .jumbo selector - and compares with a custom mismatch threshold', async function(assert) {
  await visit('/sales/company/11102');
  await backstop(assert, { scenario: { selectors: '.jumbo', misMatchThreshold: 0.05 } });
  assert.dom('#myFancyElement').exists();
});
```

See [Scenario Documentation](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS#advanced-scenarios) for what you can configure.

#### Name Option

You can add a custom name segment to your backstop test artifacts by passing a `name` property in the options.

```js
test('shows specific rental details', async function(assert) {
  await visit('/rentals');
  await click('.grand-old-mansion');
  await backstop(assert);
  await backstop(assert, { name: 'WITH A CUSTOM NAME' });
});
```

The above produces two identical backstop tests with the following titles...

```
1) Acceptance__list_rentals__shows_specific_rental_details__assert0_0_document_0_webview
2) Acceptance__list_rentals__shows_specific_rental_details__WITH_A_CUSTOM_NAME__assert1_0_document_0_webview
```

#### Using the _Kill Switch_

Taking screenshots is a heavy process and there may be conditions where you want to run Ember tests but skip all the backstop tests. For these occations there is a kill switch called `disableBackstop`.  Setting this to true will "skip" all backstop helper calls. You can configure this in enviornment.js. See below...

```js
/* environment.js */

module.exports = function(environment) {
  let ENV = {
    /* ... other existing configs ABOVE this line */

    'ember-backstop': {
      disableBackstop: process.env.DISABLE_BACKSTOP === 'true'
    }

    /* ... other existing configs BELOW this line */
  };
  return ENV;
};
```

With the above in place, setting the environment variable `DISABLE_BACKSTOP=true` will engage the kill switch. 
e.g.

```bash
DISABLE_BACKSTOP=true ember s
DISABLE_BACKSTOP=true ember test
DISABLE_BACKSTOP=true ember exam
```

#### Reference-Only mode

Sometimes you just want to generate reference screenshots -- without actually testing anything. You can tell ember-backstop to do this by setting `screenshotsOnly` to `true` in enviornment.js...

```js
/* environment.js */

module.exports = function(environment) {
  let ENV = {
    /* ... other existing configs ABOVE this line */

    'ember-backstop': {
      screenshotsOnly: true
    }

    /* ... other existing configs BELOW this line */
  };
  return ENV;
};
``` 


### More Info

See [http://backstopjs.org](http://backstopjs.org) for documentation on BackstopJS -- but keep in mind -- for this implementation all DOM interactions should probably be done in your Ember test -- and not the BackstopJS config.

### Issues

#### If your screenshots are blank

Take a look at your test network calls. Are you seeing `UnrecognizedURLError` errors? If so, there may be an issue with a middleware addon dependency loading too early. Try ensuring any server dependencies don't block proxy requests to `/backstop/`. Post the issue [here](https://github.com/garris/ember-backstop/issues) and let us know!
